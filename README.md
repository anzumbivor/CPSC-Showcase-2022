This poster was presented in the CPSC Showcase 2022 at the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. In this poster, we highlighted the concerns related to biases, fairness, and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) in online social media data mining. We defined bias in AI and presented potential factors that can introduce bias in the data mining workflow. Furthermore, we showed three strategies to mitigate biases and minimize risks and implications.
