This poster was presented in CPSC Showcase 2022 at the University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada. In this poster, we highlighted the concerns related to biases, fairness, and limitations of artificial intelligence (AI) in online social media data mining. We defined bias in AI and presented potential factors that can introduce bias in the data mining workflow. Furthermore, we presented three strategies to mitigate biases in order to minimize the risks and implications.
